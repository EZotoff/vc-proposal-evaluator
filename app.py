"""
Streamlit application for evaluating startup project proposals from a ventureâ€‘capital
perspective.  Users can upload a proposal document (PDF, DOCX or plain text) and
receive an AIâ€‘generated analysis based on common investment criteria.

The app uses OpenAIâ€™s chat API (e.g. gptâ€‘5â€‘miniâ€‘2025â€‘08â€‘07) to produce a detailed
assessment.  You will need a valid API key with access to the requested model.

The evaluation criteria are derived from the FNR JUMP Programme 2025 guidelines
for reviewers.  Each proposal is assessed on:

  * **Novelty** â€“ Is the underlying technology or concept truly novel or
    disruptive?  Does the proposal provide sufficient data to demonstrate
    scientific soundness?
  * **Market & customer understanding** â€“ For commercial projects, does the
    team understand the target market and customers?  Are there credible
    strategies for commercialisation?
  * **Social need & methodology** â€“ For social impact projects, has the
    proposal clearly identified the social need?  Is the proposed methodology
    appropriate for addressing that need and delivering value to society?
  * **Impact magnitude** â€“ What is the expected scale of the impact?  How big is
    the potential market or societal effect?
  * **Intellectual property & validation** â€“ What is the state of the IP
    protection and prior art?  Does the project include validation data or
    prototypes that deâ€‘risk the technology?
  * **Team competences** â€“ Does the team have the right mix of technical and
    business expertise to execute?  If an Entrepreneur in Residence (EiR) is
    involved, are they suitably qualified and available?  How strong is the
    broader advisory or mentor network?

The tool produces an analysis but does not make funding decisions.  Final
decisions rest with human investors; the AI serves purely as an analytical aid.
